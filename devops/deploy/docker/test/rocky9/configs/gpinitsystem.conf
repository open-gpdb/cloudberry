# gpinitsystem Configuration File for Cloudberry Database
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# This configuration file is used to initialize a Cloudberry Database
# cluster. It defines the settings for the coordinator, primary segments,
# and mirrors, as well as other important configuration options.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Segment prefix - This prefix is used for naming the segment directories.
# For example, the primary segment directories will be named gpseg0, gpseg1, etc.
SEG_PREFIX=gpseg

# Coordinator port - The port number where the coordinator will listen.
# This is the port used by clients to connect to the database.
COORDINATOR_PORT=5432

# Coordinator hostname - The hostname of the machine where the coordinator
# will be running. The $(hostname) command will automatically insert the
# hostname of the current machine.
COORDINATOR_HOSTNAME=$(hostname)

# Coordinator data directory - The directory where the coordinator's data
# will be stored. This directory should have enough space to store metadata
# and system catalogs.
COORDINATOR_DIRECTORY=/data1/coordinator

# Base port for primary segments - The starting port number for the primary
# segments. Each primary segment will use a unique port number starting from
# this base.
PORT_BASE=6000

# Primary segment data directories - An array specifying the directories where
# the primary segment data will be stored. Each directory corresponds to a
# primary segment. In this case, two primary segments will be created in the
# same directory.
declare -a DATA_DIRECTORY=(/data1/primary /data1/primary)

# Base port for mirror segments - The starting port number for the mirror
# segments. Each mirror segment will use a unique port number starting from
# this base.
MIRROR_PORT_BASE=7000

# Mirror segment data directories - An array specifying the directories where
# the mirror segment data will be stored. Each directory corresponds to a
# mirror segment. In this case, two mirror segments will be created in the
# same directory.
declare -a MIRROR_DATA_DIRECTORY=(/data1/mirror /data1/mirror)

# Trusted shell - The shell program used for remote execution. Cloudberry uses
# SSH to run commands on other machines in the cluster. 'ssh' is the default.
TRUSTED_SHELL=ssh

# Database encoding - The character set encoding to be used by the database.
# 'UNICODE' is a common choice, especially for internationalization.
ENCODING=UNICODE

# Default database name - The name of the default database to be created during
# initialization. This is also the default database that the gpadmin user will
# connect to.
DATABASE_NAME=gpadmin

# Machine list file - A file containing the list of hostnames where the primary
# segments will be created. Each line in the file represents a different machine.
# This file is critical for setting up the cluster across multiple nodes.
MACHINE_LIST_FILE=/home/gpadmin/hostfile_gpinitsystem
