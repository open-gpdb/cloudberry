# Script Name: build-deb.sh
#
# Description:
# This script automates the process of building an DEB package using a specified
# version number. It ensures that the necessary tools are installed
# and that the control file exists before attempting to build the DEB. The script
# also includes error handling to provide meaningful feedback in case of failure.
#
# Usage:
# ./build-deb.sh [-v <version>] [-h] [--dry-run]
#
# Options:
#   -v, --version <version>    : Specify the version (required)
#   -h, --help                 : Display this help and exit
#   -n, --dry-run              : Show what would be done, without making any changes
#
# Example:
#   ./build-deb.sh -v 1.5.5               # Build with version 1.5.5
#
# Prerequisites:
# - The dpkg-buildpackage package must be installed (provides the dpkg-buildpackage command).
# - The control file must exist at debian/control.
#
# Error Handling:
# The script includes checks to ensure:
# - The version option (-v or --version) is provided.
# - The necessary commands are available.
# - The control file exists at the specified location.
# If any of these checks fail, the script exits with an appropriate error message.

# Enable strict mode for better error handling
set -euo pipefail
