# Script: unittest-cloudberry.sh
# Description: Executes unit tests for Apache Cloudberry from source
#             code.  Runs the 'unittest-check' make target and logs
#             results.  Tests are executed against the compiled source
#             without requiring a full installation.
#
# Required Environment Variables:
#   SRC_DIR - Root source directory
#
# Optional Environment Variables:
#   LOG_DIR - Directory for logs (defaults to ${SRC_DIR}/build-logs)
#
# Usage:
#   ./unittest-cloudberry.sh
#
# Exit Codes:
#   0 - All unit tests passed successfully
#   1 - Environment setup failed (missing SRC_DIR, LOG_DIR creation failed)
#   2 - Unit test execution failed
